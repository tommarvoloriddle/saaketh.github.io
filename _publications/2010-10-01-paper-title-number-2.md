collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a simple yet novel way, “Coarse to Fine Bilinear Convolutional Neural Networks”, which preserves the coarse features while learning the finer features. Experiments have been performed on Hierarchical Grocery Store Image Datasets and Coarse to Fine Bilinear Convolutional Neural Networks had an accuracy of 85.33% which was better than Bilinear networks, which had an accuracy of 77.82%, and Linear networks, which had an accuracy of 72.11%.'
